# Summary Overview

## Technology

- Learn HTTP Standards
- You can base your 'bugs' on Standards
    - HTTP Message Syntax and Routing [RFC 7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230)
- Learn the common VERBS: GET, POST, DELETE, PUT
- Read the REST Dissertation


---

## Testing

- Add as much variation as you can
- Use tooling to help you
- Go beyond the outcome
- Use headers
- Read the Docs
- Read the Swagger Open API output
- Combine everything you learned
- Use a Client, send in requests as easily as possible
- Use a Proxy, trust the proxy output rather than the tool output
- Track your testing
- Save HAR files to document your results

---

## Tools - Clients

- Different tools have different capabilites
- Experiment with multiple tools
- Postman: Collections for Data Creation, Console
- Insomnia: Import, Timeline, Proxies
- Import/Export between Tools

---

## Tools - Proxies

- Often used for Security Testing
- Fuzzers create data
- Automatically keep a record of your testing
- View actual requests and responses
- Replay requests
