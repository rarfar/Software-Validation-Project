# How to complete the challenge `POST /todos (415)`

Most APIs will report an error when the `content-type` is specified as a format that they do not support.
Some APIs will parse the input using their default processing which can often result in a 500 error.
The API Challenges checks the `content-type` and if it is unsupported returns a 415 status code,
to see this we send a POST request to try and create a todo item but with unsupported content type.

## 	POST /todos (415)

> Issue a POST request on the `/todos` end point with an unsupported content type to generate a 415 status code

For this challenge we issue a request with a `content-type` which is unsupported.

- `POST` request means we will send information in the body of the message
    - e.g. `POST /todos` sends to the todos endpoint
- `unsupported content type` means that we will set `content-type` to something unknown eg. `bob`
- add the `X-CHALLENGER` header to track progress
- we know it has been rejected when we receive a `415` response
- the body of the response should contain the full details of the error message


## Basic Instructions

- Issue a `POST` request to end point "/todos"
    - if running locally that endpoint would be
        - `{{<ORIGIN_URL>}}/todos`
- The request should have an `Content-Type` header with an unsupported value e.g `bob`
- add a valid payload, but it won't match the content type so doesn't matter, but adding a valid payload makes sure that the system is not ignoring the content type specified.
- The request should have an `X-CHALLENGER` header to track challenge completion
- The response status code should be `415` when all the details are valid.
- Check the body of the response has JSON formatted error response
    - the system defaults to json for errors

Extras:

- try setting the 'accept' header to specify the format of the error message in the response
