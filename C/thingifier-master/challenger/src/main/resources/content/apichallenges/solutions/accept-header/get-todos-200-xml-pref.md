# Use Accept Headers to GET XML Content as a preference

How to complete the challenge `GET /todos XML (200)` to successfully GET all the todos in XML format as first preference.

## GET /todos XML Preference (200)

It is possible to ask for multiple types in the Accept header, expressing a preference for the returned format. If none of the types are available then expect a 406 response.

> Issue a GET request on the `/todos` end point with an `Accept` header of `application/xml` followed by `application/json` to receive results in XML format if supported, or JSON if not.

- `GET` request will receive a response with all the todo items
    - e.g. `GET /todos` to get all the todo items
- `200` is a success code, in this case it means the end point exists and the `todo items were returned
- `Accept` means that an `Accept` header was added to specify that the todos should be returned in **XML** format as first preference, followed by **JSON** as second preference
- add the `X-CHALLENGER` header to track progress


## Basic Instructions

- Issue a `GET` request to end point "/todos"
    - if running locally that endpoint would be
        - `{{<ORIGIN_URL>}}/todos`
- The request should have an `Accept` header specifying XML format by using a value of `application/xml,application/json`
- The request should have an `X-CHALLENGER` header to track challenge completion
- The response status code should be `200` when all the details are valid.
- Check the body of the message has JSON format data, which is the default from the server
- Check the `content-type` header in the response has `application/json`

The chained Accept header `application/xml,application/json` asks for XML as first preference, but if not supported then supply JSON.
