# How to complete the challenge `GET /todos (200) ? filter`

How to issue a GET request on a top level entity endpoint and use a query filter to receive a subset of data.

## GET /todos (200) ? filter

> 	Issue a GET request on the `/todos` end point with a query filter to get only todos which are 'done'. There must exist both 'done' and 'not done' todos, to pass this challenge.

- `GET` request will return all items from the `/todos` end point
- `200` is the success code meaning the request was accepted
- `?` means we need to add a URL Parameter
- `filter` means it will filter based on an attribute. In this case we are asked to filter on those which are 'done'. And this is represented by the `doneStatus` i.e. `doneStatus=true`
- We are using this request to `GET` a filter list of todo items
- Perform a `GET` first to see what the format of the message is
- Add a URL parameter to the request to repeat the `GET` and filter the list of todos e.g. `/todos?doneStatus=true`

## Basic Instructions

- Issue a `GET` request to end point "/todos"
    - `{{<ORIGIN_URL>}}/todos`
- The request should have an `X-CHALLENGER` header to track challenge completion
- Look at the returned format for todos

```js
    {
      "id": 41,
      "title": "create todo process payroll",
      "doneStatus": true,
      "description": ""
    },
```
- we want to use the `doneStatus` attribute as a URL parameter
- if you don't see any todos in the list with a `"doneStatus": true` then you will need to issue a `POST` request to create or amend a todo item. e.g. [challenge post secret 201](/apichallenges/solutions/authentication/post-secret-201)
- Issue a `GET` request with a URL parameter `/todos?doneStatus=true`
- The response status code should be `200` because the request is accepted
- If you get a different response code, check the URL or headers of the message because you made have made a typo.
- If you don't see any todos returned then you may need to create one e.g. [challenge post secret 201](/apichallenges/solutions/authentication/post-secret-201)
