# How to complete the challenge `GET /todos (406)`

Some APIs will report an error when asked for a return format that they do not support. Other APIs will respond with a default. The API Challenges will respond with a `406` status code. We can test for this by sending a GET request for all todos but pass in an 'accept' format that the system does not support.

## 	GET /todos (406)

When we issue a request with an accept header, we are asking for a specific content format in the response. But... if we ask for a format that is not supported then the system may reespond with a 406 'NOT ACCEPTABLE' status code.

> Issue a GET request on the `/todos` end point with an `Accept` header of `application/gzip` to receive a response with a `406` 'NOT ACCEPTABLE' status code.

- `GET` request asks for a response with all the todo items
    - e.g. `GET /todos` to get all the todo items
- `406` is a success code, in this case it means the accept header is not supported by the system
- add the `X-CHALLENGER` header to track progress


## Basic Instructions

- Issue a `GET` request to end point "/todos"
    - if running locally that endpoint would be
        - `{{<ORIGIN_URL>}}/todos`
- The request should have an `Accept` header with the value `application/gzip`
- The request should have an `X-CHALLENGER` header to track challenge completion
- The response status code should be `406` when all the details are valid.
- Check the body of the message has JSON formatted error message response
- Check the `content-type` header in the response has `application/json` matching the response body

Some systems may simply ignore the 'accept' header and return the response in the default format.
