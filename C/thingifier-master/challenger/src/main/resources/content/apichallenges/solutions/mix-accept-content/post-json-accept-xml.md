# How to complete the challenge `POST /todos JSON to XML`

The `content-type` and `accept` headers do not need to be the same.
API Challenges allows us to send a POST request to create a todo item using JSON but receive an XML response.

## 	POST /todos XML to JSON

> Issue a POST request on the `/todos` end point to create a todo using Content-Type `application/json` but Accept `application/xml`

- `POST` request means we will send information in the body of the message
    - e.g. `POST /todos` sends to the todos endpoint
- `create a todo` means that the payload will be valid data to create a todo item
- `using Content-Type` `application/json` means that we will set `content-type` header to `application/json` and the payload will be in JSON format
- `Accept` `application/xml` means add an `accept` header of `application/xml` to receive the response in JSON format
- add the `X-CHALLENGER` header to track progress


## Basic Instructions

We can mix different accept and content-types so we can send payloads in one format, and receive responses in another format. This challenge is about sending payload in JSON but having the response in XML.

- Issue a `POST` request to end point "/todos"
    - if running locally that endpoint would be
        - `{{<ORIGIN_URL>}}/todos`
- The request should have an `Content-Type` header of `application/json`
- add a valid payload in JSON format to create a todo item e.g.

```json
   {
        "title": "create todo process payroll",
        "doneStatus": true,
        "description": ""
   }
```


- add an `accept` header of `application/xml` to receive the response in XML format
- The request should have an `X-CHALLENGER` header to track challenge completion
- The response status code should be `201` when all the details are valid.
- Check the body of the response has XML formatted todo item with full details of the created item
- Check the location header for the REST API call to retrieve details of the created item

Extras:

- try GET the location header URL to return the created todo item
