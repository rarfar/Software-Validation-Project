# How to complete the challenge `POST /todos (201)`

How to use a POST request to create a todo item in the application and receive a 201 status response code.

## POST /todos (201)

> 	Issue a `POST` request to successfully create a todo

- `POST` request will make changes to the system
- `201` means an item created
- We are using this request to create a todo item
- Perform a `GET` first to see what the format of the message is
- Add a `Content-Type` of `application/json` to tell the server what format the message body is

## Basic Instructions

- Issue a POST request to end point "/todos"
    - `{{<ORIGIN_URL>}}/todos`
- The request should have an `X-CHALLENGER` header to track challenge completion
- Use the format for the todo which you see in the `GET` response
- Do not include an 'id' in the request because that is added automatically by the system
- The response status code should be `201` because the todo is created
- IF you get a different response code, check the body of the message because you made have made a typo. Read the error message in the response to guide you.

## Example Request

> POST /todos HTTP/1.1
> Host: {{<HOST_URL>}}

> X-CHALLENGER: x-challenger-guid
